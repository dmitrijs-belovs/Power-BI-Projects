# Power-BI-Projects

## Introduction

This repository contains various projects I have completed in Power BI to showcase my data visualization and Power BI skills.

## Superstore Sales Analysis Dashboard

### Description

The project includes a sales analysis dashboard of the Tableau sample dataset, Superstore Sales. The dataset (that can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/learn/sample-data)) contains information about orders, customers, products and sales of a fictional company that can be used to identify key areas of improvement. More detailly, it consists of 1 .xlsx file and includes:

* order information - ID, order date, ship date, ship mode
* customer information - ID, name, segment, country, city, state, postal code, region
* product informtion - ID, category, sub-category, name
* sales information - amount, quantity, discount, profit

This information allows analyzing sales by date, customer segment and location, product category, and name, which should help extract actionable insights of problematic and successful target areas of the company.
